        <h2 className="section-title">The Divine Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there lived a person named Ganja Srinivas. In 1994, Goddess Durga used to come to his dreams daily. 
          Due to these divine visions, he arranged a very small hut with a picture of Goddess Durgadevi. 
        </p>

        <h2 className="section-title">The Cyclone</h2>
        <p>
          In 1996, the hut was destroyed by a cyclone. After this incident, the villagers didn’t pay much attention. 
          But once again, Goddess Durga came into Ganja Srinivas’s dream. The villagers then decided to rebuild the hut, 
          this time with palm leaves, despite facing numerous difficulties.

        <h2 className="section-title">Building a Permanent Temple</h2>
        <p>
          In 2003, the elders of the village planned to build a permanent temple. This plan began with the first donation from Mr. Nimmakayala Jaggayya Naidu Garu. 
          With further contributions from the villagers, the temple was finally constructed.

        <h2 className="section-title">Establishing the Idol</h2>
        <p>
          On October 23, 2004, the idol was established by the couple Mr. Guttula Chinna and Miss Kameswari. Since then, October 23rd is celebrated as a festival every year. 
          Over time, the celebrations have expanded, with events like Samii Pooja, Eekaha Bajana, Deepalankarana, Teen Maar Drums, and DJ Lights & Sounds.
        </p>

        <h2 className="section-title">The Dussehra Celebration</h2>
        <p>
          Every year during Dussehra, the village gathers to celebrate the temple’s festivals. Thanks to the villagers belief in the power of Sri Vijaya Durga Amma Vari Mahathyam 
          and their generous donations, the festivities continue to reach new heights.
